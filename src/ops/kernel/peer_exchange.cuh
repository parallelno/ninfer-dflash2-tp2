// ninfer::ops::detail - the kernel behind the pinned-host mailbox transport for TP2 collectives.
//
// TRANSPORT CONTRACT (why this exists). On this machine (Windows 11 WDDM, 2x RTX 5060 Ti,
// cudaDeviceCanAccessPeer == 0) a cross-device cudaMemcpyAsync is transparently staged by the
// driver through host memory by way of the copy engine, and the event chain that orders the
// staged copy costs far more than the payload: the measured production allreduce is ~277 us per
// 10 KiB reduction (128 per decode token = ~35 ms of a ~61 ms token), of which useful transfer
// time is ~3.3 us. This kernel pair replaces the whole choreography: both ranks run one kernel
// CONCURRENTLY, publish their operand into their own pinned host slot, release a flag, spin on
// the peer's flag, then sum locally -- no events, no copy engine, no driver round trip inside
// the exchange. Measured on this machine: ~41 us per 10 KiB reduction (graph-replayed), 6.7x
// faster than the staged path.
//
// ORDERING PROTOCOL (per slot; every captured collective call site owns one).
//
//   publish:  every thread stores its 16-byte payload chunks to the rank's host slot
//             __threadfence_system()          -- payload stores leave this GPU for system memory
//             __syncthreads()                 -- the block meets
//             one thread per block: atomicAdd(arrival, 1)
//             the block that observes arrival == gridDim.x - 1 (all blocks fenced and arrived):
//                 *flag = 1                   -- release: publish is globally complete
//                 *arrival = 0                -- restore for the next replay of this slot
//   consume:  one thread per block spins on the peer flag (volatile: system-memory reads are
//             uncached on the GPU side, so the poll always observes RAM)
//             __threadfence_system()          -- acquire: payload reads ordered after the flag
//             __syncthreads()
//             every thread reads its peer payload chunks and combines
//
// Both ranks execute the same schedule, so the exchange completes as soon as each side has
// observed the other's release -- a lock-step pipeline, no circular waits: rank A's kernel for
// slot k depends only on rank B's PUBLISH for slot k, which runs on the other GPU.
//
// FLAG LIFECYCLE. Flags are host words zeroed by the engine between graph replays (the round is
// fully retired before the next launch, so the reset cannot race any GPU access). Within one
// replay each slot fires exactly once (it belongs to one captured call site), so a poller can
// never observe a stale nonzero flag from an earlier call in the same replay. Payload slots are
// per-call-site too, so a publish can never overwrite a payload a lagging consumer still reads.
//
// HANG GUARD. A poller gives up after kPeerSpinLimit probes and sets `hang`, so a broken peer
// surfaces as a reported fault instead of a silent spin until the WDDM watchdog resets the
// device. The engine checks the aggregate hang word once per round when the egress is read.
//
// ARITHMETIC. The combine is the qualified residual_add body: FP32 accumulation of the two
// represented BF16 operands, one round-to-nearest-even on store. This matches the staged path's
// local combine bit for bit (the same two partials, the same order, the same rounding), so the
// mailbox transport cannot change a single output value.
