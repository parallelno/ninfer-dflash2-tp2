// ninfer::ops - pinned-host mailbox transport for the two-device TP2 collectives.
//
// A PeerMailbox owns the pinned host memory the mailbox transport (see
// src/ops/kernel/peer_exchange.cuh) exchanges through, and installs itself as the process-wide
// transport for CAPTURED collectives. The staged, event-ordered path in allreduce.cu stays the
// only path for eager execution and oversized payloads; the mailbox serves the one shape that
// dominates decode -- small reductions replayed inside a captured CUDA graph -- where the
// measured cost is the choreography, not the bytes.
//
// MEASURED ON THIS MACHINE (2x RTX 5060 Ti, Windows 11 WDDM, no P2P):
//   staged event path (production allreduce_sum): ~277 us per 10 KiB reduction
//   mailbox exchange (graph replay):              ~41 us per 10 KiB reduction
// Over 128 reductions per decode token that is ~35 ms -> ~5 ms, the difference between a
// communication-bound decode and a compute-bound one.
//
// LIFECYCLE.
//   PeerMailbox mailbox(ec);                  once, at Program setup, next to PeerEvents
//                                             (cudaHostAlloc is not stream-ordered and must
//                                             never appear in a hot path or a capture)
//   ... capture the decode program ...
//   PeerMailbox::reset_host_flags();          once per round, between graph replays, on the
//                                             host, after the round retired on both devices
//
// WHY A PROCESS-WIDE INSTALL RATHER THAN A PARAMETER. The collective is issued deep inside the
// linear ops (linear_row_parallel, linear_add), whose public signatures carry only the
// PeerEvents pair; plumbing a second object through every layer would touch a dozen signatures
// to serve one machine-specific transport. The install is exclusive: a second PeerMailbox
// constructor on a different device pair uninstalls the first and takes over, which keeps a
// two-Program process sound (the later Program wins; the earlier one falls back to the staged
// path). Disable entirely with NINFER_TP2_MAILBOX=0 for A/B measurement.
//
// SELECTIVITY (see wants() in allreduce.cu). A captured collective uses the mailbox only when
//   * the mailbox is installed for THIS ExecutionContext,
//   * the caller's stream is capturing (this is a captured decode graph, not an eager pass or
//     a prefill chunk -- prefill's [hidden, chunk] reductions are megabytes, where the staged
//     path's bandwidth beats kernel-driven zero-copy latency, and eager calls have no
//     between-round reset point), and
//   * the payload fits a slot.
// Everything else takes the staged path unchanged, which also means a mailbox-capable Program
// degrades to today's exact behavior the moment any of these predicates fails.
